# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test files used in the test suite.

## PDF Files

To test PDF processing, you can add sample PDF files here. For testing purposes, you can:

1. Download a public domain book from Project Gutenberg in PDF format
2. Create a simple test PDF using any PDF creation tool
3. Use the provided `sample.txt` to create a test PDF

Example test PDFs should be small (< 1MB) to keep the repository size manageable.

## Sample Content

The `sample.txt` file contains sample text that can be used to create test PDFs or for other testing purposes.
